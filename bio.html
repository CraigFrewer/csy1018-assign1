        <p class="bio-paragragh">
            Craig is quite the inquisitor when it comes to something he doesn't know about.
            Whether it is a newly built personal computer, a nice looking video game on a screen, or even a play at the theatre (good luck convincing him to attend one) if you show him something interesting, he would likely be more amazed at what goes on behind the scenes and how it works. Generally, the unknown is his playground.

        <p class="bio-paragraph">
          When he's not exploring he innards of his PC, he is usually found playing video games on it, which is where his passion for tech and coding all began. A simple thought of "But wait, how does that do that then?" at the age of 4 seemed to have sparked a neuron in his brain that lead to him pursuing a career in programming.

          That's not all though, there are moments where he looks up at the sky at night. Needless to say...with the biggest curiosity out there, a lot of time has been spent observing the stars. Sometimes he'll stargaze while listening to his favourite music (mostly the Beatles, Pink Floyd, or any video game soundtrack), or with his much loved cat on his lap.

        <h2 class="bio-heading-2">You mentioned programming?</h2>
        <p class="bio-paragraph">
          I did! I'm currently learning HTML, Java, and I plan to learn a lot more while studying at the University of Northampton! You can of course ask more about me by getting in touch with me in whatever way suits you. See below for more info on how to contact me.
